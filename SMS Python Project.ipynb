    "## Student Management System Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "The goal of this project is to apply the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to build a simple Student Management System. This system will allow the management of students, courses, and enrollments, demonstrating the use of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "#### Class Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Person: A base class with common attributes for Student and Instructor.\n",
    "- Student: Inherits from Person and includes attributes specific to students.\n",
    "- Instructor: Inherits from Person and includes attributes specific to instructors.\n",
    "- Course: Represents a course with attributes such as course name, course ID, and a list of enrolled students.\n",
    "- Enrollment: Represents the enrollment of a student in a course with attributes such as student, course, and grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Functional Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ability to add, remove, and update students and instructors.\n",
    "- Ability to add, remove, and update courses.\n",
    "- Enroll students in courses.\n",
    "- Assign grades to students for specific courses.\n",
    "- Retrieve a list of students enrolled in a specific course.\n",
    "- Retrieve a list of courses a specific student is enrolled in.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Detailed Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Person Class: Define a Person class that has the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- name: Name of the person,\n",
    "- id_number: ID number of the person,\n",
    "    Include a __str__ method to return a string representation of the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Student Class: Define a Student class that inherits from Person.\n",
    "    Add an attribute major for the student's major. Override the __str__ method to include the student's major.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructor Class: Define an Instructor class that inherits from Person. \n",
    "    Add an attribute department for the instructor's department. Override the __str__ method to include the instructor's department.\n",
    "\n",
    "Course Class: Define a Course class with the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- course_name: Name of the course, \n",
    "- course_id: ID of the course,\n",
    "- enrolled_students: List to keep track of students enrolled in the course,\n",
    "    Include methods to add and remove students from the course. Override the __str__ method to return a string representation  of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrollment Class: Define an Enrollment class with the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- student: The student enrolled,\n",
    "- course: The course in which the student is enrolled,\n",
    "- grade: The grade assigned to the student (initially set to None)\n",
    "    Include a method to assign a grade to the student. Override the __str__ method to return a string representation of the enrollment.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Student Management System: Define a StudentManagementSystem class that will manage the students, instructors, courses, and enrollments. It should include methods to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add, remove, and update students and instructors\n",
    "- Add, remove, and update courses\n",
    "- Enroll students in courses\n",
    "- Assign grades to students for specific courses\n",
    "- Retrieve a list of students enrolled in a specific course\n",
    "- Retrieve a list of courses a specific student is enrolled in\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Grading Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality (40 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correct implementation of classes and their relationships (20 points)\n",
    "- Correct implementation of methods and functionalities (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Quality (35 points)\n",
    "- Proper use of OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism (15 points)\n",
    "- Code readability: clear and consistent naming conventions, comments, and documentation (15 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Completeness (25 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "- All specified requirements are met (15 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additional features or enhancements beyond the basic requirements (10 points)"
